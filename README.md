## Quickstart

1. Install Python 3.10+ and pip.
2. Install Jupyter:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade jupyter
   ```
3. Launch Jupyter and open any notebook in this repo:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. If a cell errors due to a missing package, install it in your environment (e.g., `pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn tensorflow`).
